**Technologies Used:** 

- HTML
- Chakra UI styling
- React
- Javascript

**Approach:** 

We first thought of the user stories and the use cases before drafting out wireframes, linking from one page to the other. We did a basic draft of our front end, before ensuring functionality of the website. Once that has been done, we improved the overall cohesive styling of the website. 

**User Stories:** 

1. As a traveller, I want to be able to create a trip for different trips. 
2. As a traveller, I want to be able to create various plans to build up my itinerary for the trip. 
3. As a traveller, I want to have a holistic view of all my trips/plans in one view. 
4. As a traveller, I want to update my trips and plans as my planning changes.
5. As a traveller, I want to delete my trips and plans as my planning changes.
6. As a user, I expect to view my plans upon logging in (and not others).
7. As a user, I expect to log in and log out when I desire. 
8. As a user, I expect to sign up as a new user. 

**Wireframes:**

**Unresolved Problems/Major Hurdles:** 

1. Working through merge conflicts and how our merges might affect other areas of code
